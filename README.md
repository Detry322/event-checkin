=============

A JS app for [TechX][1] that lets users type in their Athena usernames,
confirm, and submit for printing.

**Requirements**

1. You'll need to have the `athenas.json` and `studentinfo.json` files for this to work. You can generate this data by running `bootstrap/bootstrap` on Athena.
2. You'll need the Dymo drivers in order to use the label printers via USB. You can download them from [the Dymo website][2].
3.  Run either `runwindows.exe` or `runmac.sh` depending on your computer
4.  

** Additional Information **

There are some issues with some printers when using them with computers running Windows 7 when using a USB 3.0 port. A fix is available [here][4].
